    " \n",
    " - contact admin of github repo to provide access to Threat Model Cookbook (Dinis action item)\n",
    " - need to complete \"New Project Request\"\n",
    " - contact people who previously contributed/interacted with repo to the Threat Model Cookbook to inform them that an official project is being started (Tash mentioned that most are in the Slack Threat Modelling channel)\n",
    " - need to rename repository to \"cookbooks\"\n",
    " - linking references in linking.md with folders (Jonathan)\n",
    " - review the structure of the repository (for a smaller group of people)\n",
    " - add files in Jonathan's folder to the repository (Jonathan commited to end of week) \n",
    " - review licenses - (code: apache license, anything else creative commons)\n",
    " - review examples to give feedback* by raising issues (people new to Threat Modelling)\n",

    "### Things to investigate (no assigned actions)\n",
    " \n",
    " - disclaimer on front page? (not aligned with specific methodology but can point people to these)\n",
    " - look at OWASP SAMM pages to help understand how to map things to help people find things \n",
    " - have conversations with end-users to find out how they want to use the threat model cookbooks\n",
    " - How can we create TM for other OWASP projects?\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    "### Tash asked the audience what the participants of the session would like to see in this Project.\n",
    " \n",
    "- It would be great to have the same TM by different people using different techniques and methodologies\n",
    " \n",
    "- Kim (an academic researcher) may come across examples/links that may be useful to contribute. To propose such things, a PR can be created or an issue should be raised in the repo for another contributor to have a look. However, its important to note that it may depend on licenses. Although other TMs that have been done which are under creative commons could be forked for a version to be hosted in the repo.\n",
