    "Github repo - https://github.com/OWASP/threat-model-cookbook\n",
    "    \n",
    "Tash provided an overview of what has been done so far highlighting that TMs are diverse so the idea is to create a TM library and cookbooks\n",
    "to inspired by chef recipes to showcase different methodologies e.g. STRIDE vs CASPER.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's hard to see a threat model so it is relatiely unknown what a successful TM look like.\n",
    "\n",
    "Roadmap to consider:\n",
    "\n",
    " - How can we create TM for other OWASP projects?\n",
    " \n",
    "Objective of session:\n",

    " \n",
    " - contact admin of github repo to provide access to Threat Model Cookbook (Dinis action item)\n",
    " - need to complete \"New Project Request\"\n",
    " - contact people who previously contributed/interacted with repo to the Threat Model Cookbook to inform them that an official project is being started (Tash mentioned that most are in the Slack Threat Modelling channel)\n",
    " - need to rename repository to \"cookbooks\"\n",
    " - linking references in linking.md with folders (Jonathan)\n",

    " \n",
    " still need a basis of structure.\n",
    " \n",
    " Proposals:\n",
    " \n",
    " - disclaimer on front page? (not aligned with specific methodology but can point people to these)\n",
    " - provide a glossary or reference to one - we are making examples not teaching people to do anything as there are plenty of other \n",
    " \n",
    " e.g. if you are using a word in your TM, make it clear what you mean. If it is unclear a user could be done by people raising issues.\n",
    " \n",
    " Tash asked the audience what examples we would like to see?\n",
    " \n",
    " - it would be great to have the same TM by different people using different techniques and methodologies \n",
    " - look at OWASP SAMM pages to help understand how to map things to help people find things\n",
    " - have conversations with end-users to find out how they want to use the threat model cookbooks\n",
    " \n",
    " Kim (an academic researcher) may come across examples/links that may be useful to contribute. To propose such things, \n",
    " \n",
    " - depending on licenses, we can investigate other TMs that have been done which are under creative commons we should be able to fork and host a version in the repo. \n",
