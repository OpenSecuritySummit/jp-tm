    " \n",
    "- Kim (an academic researcher) may come across examples/links that may be useful to contribute. To propose such things, a PR can be created or an issue should be raised in the repo for another contributor to have a look. However, its important to note that it may depend on licenses. Although other TMs that have been done which are under creative commons could be forked for a version to be hosted in the repo.\n",
