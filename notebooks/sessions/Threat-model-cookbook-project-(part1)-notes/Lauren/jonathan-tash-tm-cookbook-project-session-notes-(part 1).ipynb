    "### Things to investigate (no assigned actions)\n",
    " \n",
    " - disclaimer on front page? (not aligned with specific methodology but can point people to these)\n",
    " - look at OWASP SAMM pages to help understand how to map things to help people find things\n",
    " - have conversations with end-users to find out how they want to use the threat model cookbooks\n",
    " - How can we create TM for other OWASP projects?\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    "### Tash asked the audience what the participants of the session would like to see in this Project.\n",
    " \n",
    "- It would be great to have the same TM by different people using different techniques and methodologies\n",
    " \n",
    "- Kim (an academic researcher) may come across examples/links that may be useful to contribute. To propose such things, a PR can be created or an issue should be raised in the repo for another contributor to have a look. However, its important to note that it may depend on licenses. Although other TMs that have been done which are under creative commons could be forked for a version to be hosted in the repo.\n",
    " \n",
    "### Various notes\n",
    "\n",
    "- The Cookbook will not be prescripting different methodologies for TM's. It will be a collation of TM examples, that use the methodologies above. A disclaimer 'we are not aligned to a specific methodolgy' could be added to the Cookbook.\n",
